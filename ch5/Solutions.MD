# Solutions to the Excerciese and Studies in Chapter 5

## Exercise 1 – Which problem statement is concise?
**Answer**: The third one - *"We have found a repeatable flaw in the Twitter Intelligence system. The codes downstream to the tweet digestion will fail if there is a gap in data coming from the tweet digestion code; gaps in the data are possible and unavoidable."* - is a concise problem statement. The first one has unnecessary information, and the second one is a possible solution to the problem.


## Exercise 2 – Which problem statement is cross-functional?
**Answer**: The second one - *” We have found a flaw that can happen again and again in the Twitter Intelligence system. The codes that are run after the tweet digestion fail because they expect all the historical data to come from the tweet digestion code.”* is cross-functional. The second one uses many technical words that are largely understood by data engineers.
