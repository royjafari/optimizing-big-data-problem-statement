# Solutions to the Excerciese and Studies in Chapter 5

## Exercise 1 – Which problem statement is concise?
**Answer**: The third one - *"We have found a repeatable flaw in the Twitter Intelligence system. The codes downstream to the tweet digestion will fail if there is a gap in data coming from the tweet digestion code; gaps in the data are possible and unavoidable."* - is a concise problem statement. The first one has unnecessary information, and the second one is a possible solution to the problem.


## Exercise 2 – Which problem statement is cross-functional?
**Answer**: The second one - *” We have found a flaw that can happen again and again in the Twitter Intelligence system. The codes that are run after the tweet digestion fail because they expect all the historical data to come from the tweet digestion code.”* is cross-functional. The second one uses many technical words that are largely understood by data engineers. 

## Exercise 3 – Which problem statement is concise, cross-functional, and knowledge-driven?
**Answer**: The third one - *”We have found a repeatable flaw in the Twitter Intelligence system. The codes downstream to the tweet digestion will fail if there is a gap in data coming from the tweet digestion code; gaps in the data are possible and unavoidable.”* -  is the middle ground between cross-functional and knowledge-driven. The first one is very concise and knowledge-driven, and the second one is too cross-functional. 

## Exercise 4 – Which problem statement is atomic?
**Answer**: The three separate problem statements are listed below.
-	Subscribers complaining about the unavailability of the services
-	Tweet digestion system has failed
-	Downstream codes to the tweet digestion system expect full data, and the gap in the data will lead to errors. 

## Exercise 5 – which problem statements are value centered and measurable?
**Answer**:
-	The first one is both measurable and value-centered. The metric to evaluate the possible solutions is the time it takes for the algorithm to work, and the value is the competitiveness of Google’s search engine usage. 
-	The second one is only measurable. The metric is how fast the API responds. It is, however, not value-centered.
-	The third one is not value centered or measurable.
