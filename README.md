**Tradeoff the initial cost of understanding against the cost of future mistakes**

## What is this book about?
After reading this book you will be able to understand and find the optimal compromise between two contradictory objectives in regard to the data-prep problem statement.
The first objective is that we would like to minimize the cost we have to incur because we will need time and resources to understand or draft the data-prep problem statement. The second objective is that we would also like to minimize the cost we would have to incur if we make mistakes due to incorrect and low-quality problem statements.

This book comprises of the following chapters:
* Chapter 1, Understanding Big Data Problems
* Chapter 2, Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
* Chapter3, Data Solution Life Cycle (DSLC)
* Chapter 4, Types of Data Manipulations
* Chapter 5, Recognizing the right data-prep problem
